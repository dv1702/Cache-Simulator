# Cache-Simulator:
#### - A Course Project containing Implementation of Direct Mapped, Set-Associative and Fully-Associative Cache
#### - LRU and Pseudo-LRU Block replacement policies are implemented for appropriate combination
## Files: 
### - Team23_A6.C - Contains Source Code of Simulator
### - traces.txt - Contains Sample Memory Address and Operation {Read('r')/ Write('w')}.
### - input.txt
####   Input: Cache size in Bytes; 
####   Block size in Bytes; 
####   Associativity: 0 for fully associative, 1 for direct-mapped, 2/4/8/16/32 for set-associative;
####   Replacement Policy: 0 for random, 1 for LRU, 2 for Pseudo-LRU; 
####   File containing memory traces (each entry containing 8-digit Hex-decimal number).
### - output.txt
